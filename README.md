# Genome_Visualiser
Code final year dynamic genome visualiser project

Version 1.0 of the Genome Visualiser Application supports basic functionality for visualising `.vcf` and `.vcf.gz` files. Unfortunately `.bcf` files are not supported for visualisation. Version 1.0 is best suited for initial Usability Testing, alowing developers to understand which features of the visualiser need to be further developed and improved in future App releases.

Version 1.0 features:
o	3 View options:
1.	Reference sequence table 
2.	Zygosity colormap 
3.	Mutation frequency histogram
o	Implemented Dataset management
o	Input validation for acceptable VCF validation
o	3 Dataset filter options:
1.	By zygosity
2.	By mutation frequency (zygosity)
3.	By ref/alt sequence (length or value)
o	1 Dataset sort option:
1.	By Quality
